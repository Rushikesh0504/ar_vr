- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: AR functionality and user interactions
- **AR.js**: Web-based augmented reality framework
- **A-Frame**: 3D web framework for VR/AR

### AR Markers
The application currently supports two preset markers:
- **Hiro Marker**: Standard AR.js marker with geometric shapes
- **Kanji Marker**: Japanese character marker with text and torus

## üé® Customization

### Adding Custom Markers
You can add custom markers by modifying the HTML:

```html
<a-marker preset="custom" url="path/to/your/marker.patt">
    <a-box position="0 0.5 0" material="color: red;"></a-box>
</a-marker>
```

### Adding Custom 3D Objects
Use A-Frame entities to add 3D objects:

```html
<a-marker preset="hiro">
    <!-- Your custom 3D objects here -->
    <a-sphere position="0 1 0" radius="0.5" material="color: blue;"></a-sphere>
    <a-text value="Hello AR!" position="0 2 0"></a-text>
</a-marker>
```

### Styling Customization
Modify `styles.css` to customize the appearance:
- Change color schemes in CSS variables
- Adjust button styles and animations
- Modify layout and responsive breakpoints
